"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modules util Classes ArtifactNotesDB notesdb A text file notes database The text &quot;database&quot; is just a data structure (schema) and a set of functions to manipulate a structured directory. The &quot;database&quot; is referred to as a binder. The binder contains sections. Each of the sections contain notebooks. Each notebook contains artifacts (files). The general structure of the binder is: {binder}/ {section}/ {notebook 1}/ - {artifact 1} - {artifact 2} - {artifact N} {notebook 2}/ - {artifact 1} - {artifact 2} - {artifact N} {section N}/ ... The main component is the artifact. These are the text files. The other items in the structure above are basic file directory strutures. Features TODO InstallationTo install as a global package and cli: $ npm install --global notesdbTo install as an application dependency with cli: $ npm install --save-dev notesdbUsageCreating an InstanceTo construct a new instance: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB();Loads a default instance of the schema. This example contains no configuration options. It will use the default configuration directory of ~/.notesdb. The configuration file for this instance is saved in ~/.notesdb/config.json. The log file for the database is saved within this directory in ~/notesdb/notesdb.log. The default name of the database is adb (the name of the binder) and is saved in ~/.notesdb/adb. This is where all sections, notebooks, and artifacts will be saved. An instance can be created with a new set of defaults: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB({ binderName: 'sampledb', root: '~/mydb' });This will create a new binder with the name sampledb. It also changes where the configuration will be saved root option. This is the default location where the schema will be stored. If the only the root is specified, then the configuration is also located in this directory. This database is saved in ~/mydb/sampledb. The configuration and the database can be separated: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB({ binderName: 'sampledb', configRoot: '~/mydbconfig', root: '~/mydb' });This will create the database in ~/mydb/sampledb and the configuration/logs are stored in ~/mydbconfig. #### APIThe API is generated with JSDoc.

Objects must be created with the factory Members buffer Takes the current input &quot;buf&quot;, converts it to a buffer, and returns it Methods &lt;static&gt; factory(mode [, opts]) A factory method for creating different types of artifacts. The mode determines what type of Artifact object will be factory and returned. The types include: all|default - use a object with properties for each field to factory the object and set its properties treeitem - represents an object that can be parsed in the treetitem format of {section}/{notebook}/{filename} empty - just return an empty object.

"},"NotesDB.html":{"id":"NotesDB.html","title":"Class: NotesDB","body":" Documentation Modules util Classes ArtifactNotesDB Class: NotesDB NotesDB Creates an instance of the text database class new NotesDB( [opts]) Creates the instance of the NotesDB class and loads or defines the initial configuration parameters. If the schema already exists, then it will be loaded. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description opts object &lt;optional&gt; optional parameters binderName {string} default='adb': The name of the binder when a new database is being created. This is optional. When loading an existing database the name of the binder is retrieved as part of the configuration. configRoot {string} default='~/.notesdb': The name of the configuration directory where the configuration and log files are located. env {object}: a copy of the current runtime environment variables. This allows for the environment to be changed before instantiating the class (for multiple instances and testing). ignore {Array}: the list of file names that this database will ignore when parsing/processing artifacts. root {string} default='~/.notesdb': The path location to the database. This is optional and only needed when creating a new database. saveInterval {number} default='5000': determines how often a save check is performed. The schema is scanned and saved very N millis. Methods add(artifact, area, self) Creates the requested artifact within the schema. This will attempt to create each section, notebook, and document given. If the item is empty, then it is ignored. Parameters: Name Type Description artifact Artifact the artifact object to create (see above) area string the namespace area within the schema object to search. There are two areas: notes &amp; trash. self NotesDB a reference to the notes database instance Returns: a javascript promise object Type Promise create(schema, area, self) Creates new sections within a binder. Parameters: Name Type Description schema Array | string a list of directories (sections) under this binder location.
