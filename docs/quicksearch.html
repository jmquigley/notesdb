"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modules util Classes ArtifactNotesDB notesdb A text file notes database The text &quot;database&quot; is just a data structure (schema) and a set of functions to manipulate a structured directory. The &quot;database&quot; is referred to as a binder. The binder contains sections. Each of the sections contain notebooks. Each notebook contains artifacts (files). The general structure of the binder is: {binder}/ {section}/ {notebook 1}/ - {artifact 1} - {artifact 2} - {artifact N} {notebook 2}/ - {artifact 1} - {artifact 2} - {artifact N} {section N}/ ... The main component is the artifact. These are the text files. The other items in the structure above are basic file directory structures. Sections and notebooks are just organizing constructs (directories). Features Promised based public API Automatic timed save of documents Trashcan InstallationTo install as a global package and cli: $ npm install --global notesdbTo install as an application dependency with cli: $ npm install --save-dev notesdbUsageThe public api contains the following functions: add() create() emptyTrash() find() get() hasArtifact() hasNotebook() hasSection() notebooks() reload() remove() restore() save() saveArtifact() sections() shutdown() toString() Creating an InstanceTo construct a new instance: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB();Loads a default instance of the schema. This example contains no configuration options. It will use the default configuration directory of ~/.notesdb. The configuration file for this instance is saved in ~/.notesdb/config.json. The log file for the database is saved within this directory in ~/notesdb/notesdb.log. The default name of the database is adb (the name of the binder) and is saved in ~/.notesdb/adb. This is where all sections, notebooks, and artifacts will be saved. An instance can be created with a new set of defaults: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB({ binderName: 'sampledb', root: '~/mydb' });This will create a new binder with the name sampledb. It also changes where the configuration will be saved root option. This is the default location where the schema will be stored. If the only the root is specified, then the configuration is also located in this directory. This database is saved in ~/mydb/sampledb. The configuration and the database can be separated: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB({ binderName: 'sampledb', configRoot: '~/mydbconfig', root: '~/mydb' });This will create the database in ~/mydb/sampledb and the configuration/logs are stored in ~/mydbconfig. Creating SectionsOnce an instance is created sections can be added. There are two ways to do this. The create() or add. Using the create method: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.create(['Test1', 'Test2']) .then((adb: NotesDB) =&gt; { let sections = adb.sections(); sections.forEach((section: string) =&gt; { console.log(` ~&gt; ${section}`); }); return adb; }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });This will create two new sections within the schema named Test1 and Test2. It will also contain Default and Trash. Sections can also be created through the add method. This method uses an Artifact object during creation. const Artifact = require('artifact').Artifact; const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.add(Artifact.factory('all', {section: 'Test1'})) .then((adb: NotesDB) =&gt; { let sections = adb.sections(); sections.forEach((section: string) =&gt; { console.log(` ~&gt; ${section}`); }); return adb; }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });Creating NotebooksA notebook is created with the add method. const Artifact = require('artifact').Artifact; const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.add(Artifact.factory('all', {section: 'Test1', notebook: 'MyNotebook'})) .then((artifact: Artifact) =&gt; { console.log(artifact.toString()); let notebooks = adb.notebooks(); notebooks.forEach((notebook: string) =&gt; { console.log(` ~&gt; ${notebook}`); }); return adb; }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });This will create a section named Test1 (if it doesn't exist) and a notebook within that section named MyNotebook. Creating ArtifactsAn artifact is the basic document within the notebook. These are always text files. That are created with the add method: const Artifact = require('artifact').Artifact; const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.add({ section: 'Test1', notebook: 'MyNotebook', filename: 'myfile.txt' }) .then((artifact: Artifact) =&gt; { console.log(artifact.toString()); }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });Retrieving ArtifactsArtifacts are placed into the system by adding them (as above) or when an instance is created (the existing artifacts are loaded automatically). The artifacts are then retrieved from the system using the get method. When retrieving an artifact one must use section, notebook, and filename to retrieve it: const Artifact = require('artifact').Artifact; const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.get({ section: 'Default', notebook: 'Default', filename: 'test1.txt' }) .then((artifact: Artifact) =&gt; { // do something with the artifact }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });Finding ArtifactsOne can also retrieve artifacts using the find method. This will perform a regex text search, using JavaScript regex, using all artifacts that are in the system. It will return an array of artifacts that contain the search string. const Artifact = require('artifact').Artifact; const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.find('#1') .then((artifacts: Array&lt;Artifact&gt;) =&gt; { artifacts.forEach((artifact: Artifact) =&gt; { console.log(artifact.absolute()); }); }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { t.fail(`${t.title}: ${err}`); });This call would find all artifacts that contain the string #1 and return an array. Removing/Restoring ArtifactsArtifacts are not removed from the system directly. They are first moved to a special Trash folder within the notebook. An artifact is removed with the remove method. A removed artifact can be recovered from the trash using the restore method: const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); let lookup = { section: 'Test2', notebook: 'Default', filename: 'test4.txt' } adb.remove(lookup) .then((filename: string) =&gt; { console.log(`removed: ${filename}`); return adb.restore(lookup); }) .then((filename: string) =&gt; { console.log(`restored: ${filename}`); }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { t.fail(`${t.title}: ${err}`); });The example above would remove the artifact /Test2/Default/test4.txt and place it in the trash. After it is removed it is immediately restored back to its original path. If there is a name collision on delete/restore, then the current timestamp is placed on the artifacts name. In this example a file artifact is removed. Sections and notebooks can also be removed/restored. Emptying the TrashArtifacts that were removed are not permanently removed until the trash is emptied. That is performed with the emptyTrash method. const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.emptyTrash() .then((adb: NotesDB) =&gt; { assert(_.isEmpty(adb.schema.trash)); }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { t.fail(`${t.title}: ${err}`); });ShutdownThe shutdown method immediately saves the binder, marks the instance as uninitialized, and turns off the automatic saving of documents. It's a way to ensure proper cleanup once finished using this binder. const NotesDB = require('notesdb').NotesDB; let adb = new NotesDB(); adb.shutdown() .then((msg: string) =&gt; { console.log(msg); }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { t.fail(`${t.title}: ${err}`); });It returns a message indicating that the binder was shutdown.
